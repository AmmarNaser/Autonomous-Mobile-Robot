# Autonomous Mobile Robot Graduation Project

## Project Overview

This Git repository contains the source code and documentation for an Autonomous Mobile Robot Graduation Project. The project focuses on developing an autonomous mobile robot capable of performing various tasks in a real-world environment. It serves as the culmination of a student's academic journey and showcases their skills in robotics, control systems, and artificial intelligence.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** The robot is equipped with sensors and algorithms that enable it to navigate and avoid obstacles in an unknown environment.
- **Task Execution:** The robot can perform specific tasks, such as mapping, object recognition, or delivery, depending on the project's objectives.
- **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface may be included to control and monitor the robot's operations.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation, including design specifications, technical guides, and project reports, is provided to assist users and other developers in understanding the project.

## Repository Structure

- **src:** This directory contains the source code for the robot's control system, sensors, and any other software components.
- **docs:** All project documentation, including design documents, technical specifications, and user guides, is stored here.
- **data:** Any datasets or data used in training machine learning models, sensor data, or logs may be found in this directory.
- **hardware:** Information related to the robot's hardware, including schematics, CAD files, and 3D models.
- **media:** Images, videos, and graphical assets that can be useful for project presentations or promotional materials.
